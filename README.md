## Description

-The motivation of this project was to use jquery and bootstrap to create a Kanban board which can be used to organize tasks and when the tasks are due.  This project focused on using the draggable and droppable functions used in jquery to make our Kanban board functional.

## Usage

In order to use the app you first need to select "add task".  From there you are able to select the title of the project, the date the project is due, and finally, a short description of the project.  Once the task has been created you can drag and drop it into the correct swim lane depending whether the is in progress or complete. Each task has a delete button so when you no longer need the given task you may delete it.
